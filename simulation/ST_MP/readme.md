# Steady 2D Multizone Axial Turbine
This folder contains a test case representing a two-dimensional stator-rotor domain of an axial turbomachine.
For the harmonic balance unsteady version of this same test case, please refer [here](../US_HB).
 
The stage is characterized by a flow coefficient of 0.55, work coefficient (psi) of 1.1 and degree of reaction of 0.35. A list of the other set of main stage characteristics is shown in the table below. Î± represents the volumetric flow ratio.

The geometry as shown in the figure is a result of several meanline design steps, mainly in the `meangen` and `stagen` tools of the `Multall` software suite.

### Mesh
The mesh is created using the in-house `umg2` software. More information and input files for the meshing process can be found [here](.../meshing). The mesh consists of a mostly unstructured grid throughout the flow domain and a structured boundary layer close to the blade surface. The amount of grid cells and the mesh performance has been verified with a mesh convergence study, shown below.

### Run
This simulation was only performed and checked functional in the `feature_turbomachinery` branch of `SU2`.
As discussed in much more detail in the Bitbucket `SU2` tutorial series, the test case can be run in series using

``SU2_CFD -f a1_air_steady.cfg``

or in parallel with

``parallel_computation.py -f a1_air_steady.cfg -n <number of cores>``

Both the config and mesh files are present in this folder.

### Results
The figures below visualize the relative Mach and entropy contours that result from the simulation of this test case.
