# Thesis Test Cases
This repository contains a selection of test cases set up in the context of the master thesis work on 'Best Practices for Adjoint-based Shape Optimization of Turbomachinery Stages'. All cases correspond to a 2D stator-rotor turbine cascade.

#### 1. [Meshing](meshing) contains the background and input files required to set up the mesh for the test case in the in-house *UMG2* software.

#### 2. [Simulation](simulation) features the config and mesh files required to set up both [steady-state MP](simulation/ST_MP) and [unsteady HB](simulation/US_HB) flow simulations in *SU2*, along with instructions.

#### 3. [Optimization](optimization) explains and provides the config and mesh files required to set up both [steady-state MP](optimization/ST_MP) and [unsteady HB](optimization/US_HB) shape optimizations in *SU2*.
